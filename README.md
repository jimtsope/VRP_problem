# VRP_problem
The problem calls for the construction of the cost-minimizing vehicle routes. All vehicle routes begin from and terminate at node {0}. Each node N = {1,2,...n} needs to be visited at most once. Not all nodes need to be visited, only the required number from each family. Finally, vehicle capacity constraints must be respected.
